## Overview

AstroCore puts you in the captain's chair of a ship where every system is one power fluctuation away from disaster! Dive deep into scientifically-plausible ship management as you route power through overheating conduits, balance life support against thruster capacity, and pray your jury-rigged repairs hold long enough to reach the next outpost. Unlike those captains in shiny TV shows, your adventures through space will be less about dramatic speeches and more about frantically analyzing efficiency graphs while something important catches fire.
